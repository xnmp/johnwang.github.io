### More Information

I recently completed a data sciece course at General Assembly where they referred to themselves as a community of lifelong learners. I'm stealing that term. I want to learn it all. My interests are:

- Data science, especially neural networks and AI.
- Maths, especially algebra. One day I hope to be able to read the [Stacks Project](http://stacks.math.columbia.edu/browse) and understand it. 
- Functional programming, especially Haskell.
